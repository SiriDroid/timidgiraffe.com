Privacy Policy

This app (“GPS Flow”) is designed to assist traffic engineers in collecting travel-time data for traffic analysis and engineering purposes. We respect user privacy and clearly outline below what information is collected and how it is handled.

1. Information We Collect

When the App is in use, it records:

Latitude

Longitude

Speed

Timestamp

These data points are used solely for generating travel-time logs for engineering analysis.

The App does not collect:

Personal identity information

Account details

Device identifiers

Contact information

2. Purpose of Data Collection

The collected data is used exclusively for:

Analyzing trip routes

Measuring travel times

Supporting traffic engineering studies and transportation research

The App does not use the data for tracking individuals or creating user profiles.

3. Data Storage

All recorded data is stored locally on the user’s device in CSV format.

No data is uploaded, transmitted, or synced to remote servers or cloud services by the App.

Users may delete the locally stored CSV files at any time.

4. Data Sharing

The App does not automatically share any data.

Users may choose to manually share CSV files with traffic engineering teams using the device’s built-in sharing features (e.g., email, AirDrop, messaging apps).

The developer and traffic engineers do not receive any data unless a user intentionally sends it.

5. Permissions

To function properly, the App requires:

Location Access: Needed to collect location, speed, and timestamp data. This is only used while the App is actively running.

The App does not request or access other personal permissions such as contacts, photos, or media.

6. Children’s Privacy

This App is intended for use by traffic engineers and is not designed for children.
The App collects no personal data and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

7. Third-Party Services

The App does not use:

Analytics services

Advertising networks

Third-party SDKs that collect user data

8. Data Security

All data remains on the user’s device and is protected by the device’s built-in security features.
Because no data is transmitted externally, exposure risk is minimized.

9. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy as needed for operational or regulatory reasons. Any updates will appear within the App or on its listing, with a revised effective date.
