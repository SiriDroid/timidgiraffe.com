Privacy Policy for Slimothy

Last Updated: January 25, 2026

Slimothy is a health and weight tracking application developed by Sirisha Dhulipala. This policy explains how the app handles your data.

1. Data Collection

Slimothy collects the following information that you voluntarily enter:
- Weight entries (numerical values)
- Timestamps (date and time of entries)
- Optional notes associated with weight and health entries
- Your preferred unit of measurement (kg or lbs)

The app does not collect personal identity information, device identifiers, or any data beyond what you explicitly enter.

2. Data Storage

All weight data is stored locally on your device. If you choose to enable Google Drive sync:
- Your weight entries are backed up to your personal Google Drive account
- Data is stored in a CSV file within your own Drive storage
- You maintain full control over this data through your Google account

3. Google Sign-In

The app offers optional Google Sign-In for backup purposes only. When you sign in:
- We request access only to app-specific data in your Google Drive
- We do not access your emails, contacts, or other Google services
- You can revoke access at any time through your Google account settings

4. Data Sharing

Slimothy does not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties. Your weight tracking information remains private to you.

5. Third-Party Services

The app does not integrate advertising networks, analytics services, or data-collecting SDKs beyond the Google Drive API for optional backup functionality.

6. Data Security

- Local data is stored using your device's standard security mechanisms
- Google Drive sync uses Google's secure authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- No data is transmitted to Timid Giraffe servers

7. Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time:
- Use the "Delete All" feature within the app to remove all local entries
- Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data
- Google Drive backups can be deleted directly from your Google Drive

8. Children's Privacy

Slimothy is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13 years of age.
